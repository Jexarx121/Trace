# Trace
Website for volunteers to record their efforts and receive redeemable credits as a reward. They can redeeem this credits in future to request for assistance of their own. 

People that require assistance expend credits and wait for a volunteer to accept their request.

The credits and requests are stored on the blockchain through smart contracts. The credits are an ERC20 smart contract.

This was a final year project and a first real experience into React, Typescript, Solidity and Blockchain. Tailwind CSS for used for design. To run this, you need env variables for both folders.
